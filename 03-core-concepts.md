# Core Concepts

Extimator uses a few key building blocks. Understanding them makes estimates faster and more consistent.

## Projects

A project is the top level container. Each project has its own categories, tasks, roles, pricing model, and sprint settings.

## Categories

Categories group related work. Example categories are Discovery, Design, and Implementation.

## Tasks

Tasks live inside categories. Each task can have:
- A name and description
- One or more role assignments
- Hours per role
- Optional risk markup

## Roles

Roles represent delivery roles such as Lead Developer or UX Designer. Roles have a default hourly rate and drive effort and cost totals.

## Sprint settings

Sprint settings define:
- Sprint length and count
- Meeting templates
- Capacity and load

## General costs

General costs are percentage based adjustments such as risk buffer or overhead.
