# Pricing Models and Costs

Extimator supports multiple pricing models and cost adjustments.

## Pricing models

- Time and Materials
- Fixed Price
- Hybrid

Set the model in the Pricing panel. This affects how totals are presented in summaries and exports.

## Role rates

Each role has an hourly rate. Tasks inherit their cost from assigned roles and hours.

## General costs and risk buffer

General costs add percentage based adjustments. Examples include:
- Risk buffer
- Overhead

These are applied after base effort totals.
