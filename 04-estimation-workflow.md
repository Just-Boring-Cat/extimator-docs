# Estimation Workflow

This is a simple flow that matches the workspace layout.

## 1. Create or select a project

Use New Estimation to start fresh or select an existing project from the sidebar.

## 2. Add categories

Create high level buckets such as Discovery, Design, and Build. Keep categories short and clear.

## 3. Add tasks

For each category, add tasks and assign roles with hours. You can split hours across multiple roles.

## 4. Assign roles and rates

Set rates per role in the Pricing and Team panel. Rates are used for totals and summaries.

## 5. Configure sprints

Set sprint length, number of sprints, and meetings. This creates a capacity view and meeting load totals.

## 6. Review totals

Check the Summary panel for effort, risk buffer, and final totals.

## 7. Save and export

Click Save to persist. Use Export to generate Excel or PDF summaries.

## Next step
