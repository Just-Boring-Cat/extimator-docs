# Sprint Planning and Meetings

Sprint settings let you compare effort with delivery capacity.

## Sprint length and count

Set the length in weeks and number of sprints. This is used to estimate total available capacity.

## Meetings

Create meeting templates with:
- Name
- Frequency per sprint
- Duration
- Roles that attend

Meetings only count toward effort if at least one role is selected.

## Capacity and load

The sprint panel shows:
- Planned capacity
- Estimated load
- Remaining capacity

Use this to validate whether the estimate fits the available delivery window.

## Next step

Review pricing models and general costs.
