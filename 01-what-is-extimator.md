# What is Extimator?

Extimator is a one page estimation workspace for freelancers, consultants, and teams. It helps you turn a project scope into a structured estimate with clear roles, hours, sprint capacity, and exports you can share with clients.

## What Extimator does

- Builds structured estimates in a single workspace
- Breaks work into categories and tasks
- Assigns roles and hours so totals update in real time
- Plans sprints, meetings, and capacity
- Exports clean Excel and PDF summaries

## What Extimator does not do

- It is not a project management tool
- It does not track time
- It is not a full billing system

## Typical use cases

- Build a proposal estimate for a client
- Create a sprint and capacity plan before delivery
- Export a clean summary for internal or external review
